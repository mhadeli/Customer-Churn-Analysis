# Customer Churn Analysis with SQL and Tableau

This repository is part of my portfolio, demonstrating my proficiency in SQL and Tableau through a customer churn analysis project. Here, I apply data extraction and visualization techniques to analyze customer churn metrics for a SaaS business.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used SQL to query a real-world customer database and extract key insights related to customer behavior. I then visualized these insights in Tableau, creating a multi-page dashboard that tells the story of customer churn, retention, and lifetime value. This work reflects my ability to leverage data analytics to identify patterns, uncover revenue-impacting insights, and support strategic decision-making.

## Skills and Tools Demonstrated

- **SQL for Data Extraction**: Wrote SQL queries to pull relevant customer data from MySQL, focusing on metrics related to churn, retention, and customer lifetime value.
- **Data Visualization with Tableau**: Built a multi-page, well-formatted dashboard in Tableau that visualizes key insights, including churn trends, cohort analysis, and revenue breakdowns.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Applied data analytics to calculate and interpret metrics such as customer retention rate, re-subscription rate, and churn rate, providing a comprehensive view of customer behavior.
- **Business Acumen**: Used data to develop actionable insights that could potentially enhance customer retention and increase revenue.

## Key Components

1. **Data Preparation**  
   Structured and cleaned data to ensure accuracy and relevance for the analysis.

2. **Churn Analysis in Tableau**  
   Created charts and visualizations to highlight customer churn patterns and trends, including:
   - Retention and churn rates over time
   - Cohort analysis to track user behavior by subscription date
   - Customer lifetime value and revenue contributions

3. **Dashboard Creation and Interpretation**  
   Developed a multi-page Tableau dashboard that presents a clear and interactive overview of churn metrics, lifetime value, and revenue breakdowns, with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

This project showcases my ability to utilize SQL and Tableau for in-depth data analysis and visualization, reinforcing my skills in data-driven decision-making and customer behavior analysis.
